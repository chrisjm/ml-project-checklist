Of course. Here is an initial project plan for creating your SvelteKit and TailwindCSS checklist application.

### **Project Overview**

The goal is to build a responsive, mobile-first web application for managing machine learning projects using a standardized checklist. Users will be able to create new projects from a template, manage checklist items, and add notes. All project data will be stored locally in the user's browser.

### **Core Technologies**

* **Framework:** SvelteKit
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS
* **Data Storage:** Browser LocalStorage

---

### **Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Setup**

This initial phase focuses on setting up the development environment and creating the basic structure of the application.

DONE **Task 1: Initialize SvelteKit Project**
    * Use `npm create svelte@latest` to bootstrap a new SvelteKit project.
    * Select TypeScript for type safety and Prettier for code formatting.

DONE **Task 2: Integrate TailwindCSS**
    * Follow the official SvelteKit guide to add TailwindCSS to the project.
    * Configure the `tailwind.config.js` file to purge unused styles for production builds.

* **Task 3: Create Core Layout and Routing**
    * Define the main application layout in `src/routes/+layout.svelte` to include a header and a primary content area.
    * Set up the basic page routes:
        * `/`: The main page to display a list of all projects.
        * `/[projectId]`: A dynamic route to display the checklist for a specific project.

### **Phase 2: Project CRUD Functionality**

This phase implements the core features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting projects.

* **Task 1: Develop LocalStorage Service**
    * Create a Svelte store (`src/lib/stores/projectStore.js`) to manage the state of the projects.
    * This store will handle all interactions with `localStorage`, including loading projects on application start and saving any changes.

* **Task 2: Implement Project Creation**
    * On the main page, add a "New Project" button.
    * When clicked, this button will prompt for a project name and then generate a new project object. This object will be pre-populated with the full checklist structure from your `homl-project-checklist.md` file.
    * The new project will be saved to LocalStorage via the store.

* **Task 3: Implement Project List and Deletion**
    * The main page (`/`) will subscribe to the project store and display a list of all created projects.
    * Each item in the list will link to its corresponding project detail page (`/[projectId]`).
    * Add a "Delete" button for each project that removes it from the store and LocalStorage.

### **Phase 3: Checklist and Notes Interactivity**

This phase focuses on making the checklist and notes sections fully interactive.

* **Task 1: Create Reusable Components**
    * **ChecklistItem:** A Svelte component that takes an item's text and its completion status as props. It will manage its own state (checked/unchecked).
    * **ChecklistSection:** A component that displays a major section title (e.g., "Frame the Problem") and renders a list of `ChecklistItem` components.

* **Task 2: Implement Checklist Management**
    * On the project detail page, render the checklist using the components from the previous step.
    * Allow users to **toggle the completion status** of each checklist item.
    * Add controls to **add new, custom checklist items** to any section.
    * Implement functionality to **remove checklist items**. All changes will be persisted to LocalStorage.

* **Task 3: Implement Notes**
    * Within each `ChecklistSection` component, add a textarea for notes.
    * Bind the value of this textarea to the corresponding project's data model.
    * Ensure that notes are automatically saved to LocalStorage as the user types (a technique known as "autosave").

### **Phase 4: Styling and Responsive Design**

The final phase is dedicated to ensuring the application is visually appealing and works seamlessly across all devices.

* **Task 1: Apply Mobile-First Styling**
    * Use TailwindCSS utility classes to style all components for a clean, modern look.
    * Design for small screens first, ensuring the application is fully usable on a mobile device.

* **Task 2: Implement Responsive Breakpoints**
    * Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to adapt the layout for larger screens. For example, the project list might be a single column on mobile and a multi-column grid on a desktop.

* **Task 3: Refine User Experience**
    * Add subtle transitions and animations for a smoother user experience.
    * Ensure all interactive elements have clear visual feedback (e.g., hover and focus states).
    * Conduct a final review of the entire application to ensure consistency and ease of use.
